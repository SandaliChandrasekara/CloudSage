CloudSage - AI-Based Cloud Cost Prediction and Budget  Management Tool

**Project Description:**

CloudSage is a tool that helps businesses manage their cloud budgets better. By looking at how they've used cloud services in the past, CloudSage predicts how much they'll spend in the future. It uses smart technology to give practical advice on how to save money and use cloud resources more efficiently. This way, companies can avoid overspending and make smarter decisions about their IT costs.

**Tech Stack:**

Generative AI:
• GPT-4: Used for analyzing historical usage patterns and predicting future costs.
Cloud Computing:
• AWS/Azure/GCP: For accessing historical usage data and deploying the predictive 
model.
Backend:
• Python: The primary language for developing the predictive model and API.
• Frameworks: Flask for API development.
Database:
• MongoDB: For storing historical usage data and cost predictions.
• PostgreSQL: Alternatively, for storing structured data and ensuring data integrity.
Frontend:
• React.js: For developing a user-friendly dashboard to display cost predictions and budget 
management tools.
